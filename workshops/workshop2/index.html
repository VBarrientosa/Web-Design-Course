				<h2>CAN SPINAL DECOMPRESSION HELP YOUR LEG, NECK OR BACK PAIN?</h2>
				<p>Spinal Decompression has become the most advanced non-surgical tool aimed at treating arm, leg, neck and backpain associated with disc herniations and degeneration.</p>
				<p>In January 2002, Dr. Caruso was among the first chiropractors to introduce this breakthough technology to Westchester Count. Since then, Dr. Caruso's Scarsdale, NY based facility, Spine Care, has established a unique precedent with the succes of pre and post MRI scans.<br>His impressive results have now inspired a large network of referring phy sicians and chiropactors (troughout Westchester County and Manhattan) who work closely with Dr. Caruso.</p>
